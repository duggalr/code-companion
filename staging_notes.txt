TODO:
- setup celery and redis (<-- literally should be prehooks before application starts)
- update the env variables accordingly
- create basic tests for the staging url to ensure it works
- setup staging for frontend in vercel
- update urls with .env variables to test the staging api
- ^get staging to completely work
    - then setup CI/CD and figure out how to do the production environment
